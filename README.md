## Description
The website that I am creating is a movie information website. Upon entering the website, there will be a search bar for the user to type in their desired movie title that 
they wish to research about the details and the search results will be displayed on the screen. The user can then click on the movie details button to see the movie details displayed like 
Genre, Runtime, Rating, IMDB rating, plot, etc. The websute has a login page for members to login. The searchbar will help users to filter their results based on the movie title or closest 
alphabet.

### User Audience Intent and Purpose
The movie info website that I created will be valuable to people who want to know which blockbusters are worth watching and the plot of the movies so that when users watch the movie in cinemas,
they won't be lost. On top of that, they will be able to know the rating of the show and to know whether it is PG, PG13, etc.and whether the movie is suitable for family with children below a certain age.
The website has filters to allow users to search easily with the keywords that the user has typed into the searchbar.


#### Documentation and Research Done (References)
I used this [website](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/build-a-movie-info-search-app-ea39e1df6fdd)
to inspire me to create a movie information website and the layout of the website. The next [website](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/10-most-popular-movies-apis/brief/2019/05/19) allowed me to find out
the recommended movie apis that has a plethora of information about the various movies. After scrutinising every recommendation in that websote I found that the most suitable api was omdb api. Here's the [link](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
However, they needed a code to use their api and there was limited access of 1000 people daily. I got the code by requesting and there was still sufficient access for that day. Other than that, the api was user friendly and there was lots of movie details in it.
I used a css bootstrap for my background of the website. [Link to css bootstrap](https://bootswatch.com/4/solar/bootstrap.min.css).
