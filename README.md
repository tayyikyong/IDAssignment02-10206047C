## Description
The website that I am creating is a movie information website. Upon entering the website, there will be a search bar for the user to type in their desired movie title that 
they wish to research about the details and the search results will be displayed on the screen. The user can then click on the movie details button to see the movie details displayed like 
Genre, Runtime, Rating, IMDB rating, plot, etc. The website has a login page for members to login. The searchbar will help users to filter their results based on the movie title or closest alphabet.

### User Audience Intent and Purpose
The movie info website that I created will be valuable to people who want to know which blockbusters are worth watching and the plot of the movies so that when users watch the movie,
they will get a generic idea of what the movie is about. On top of that, they will be able to know the rating of the show and to know whether it is PG, PG13, etc. and whether the movie is suitable for family with young children.
The website has filters to allow users to search easily with the keywords that the user has typed into the searchbar.


#### Documentation and Research Done (References)
I used this [website](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/build-a-movie-info-search-app-ea39e1df6fdd)
to inspire me to create a movie information website and the layout of the website. The next [website](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/10-most-popular-movies-apis/brief/2019/05/19) allowed me to find out
the recommended movie apis that has a plethora of information about the various movies. After scrutinising every recommendation in that websote I found that the most suitable api was omdb api. Here's the [link](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
However, they needed a code to use their api and there was limited access of 1000 people daily. I got the code by requesting and there was still sufficient access for that day. Other than that, the api was user friendly and there was lots of movie details in it.
I used a css bootstrap for my background of the website. [Link to css bootstrap](https://bootswatch.com/4/solar/bootstrap.min.css).

##### Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
   * The project uses CSS to make it responsive across different browsers and to create the login page. 
3. Javascript
   * The project uses Javascript to display relevant search results when the user types in the search bar. 
4. JSON
   * The project uses JSON to send the data from the server to the website.
5. JQuery
   * The project uses JQuery to get the movie information api.
6. bootstrap
   * The project uses bootstrap for the background of the website.
7. Adobe XD
   * Adobe XD was used to create the wireframe for my website.

###### Testing
Automated testing was done for the website such as the W3C MarkUp Validation, W3C CSS Validation and jshint linter and were all passed through.

###### Deployment
After making commits from visual studio code to GitHub, and checked that the code was regularly updated after I was done coding my website, I published my website via GitHub Pages. The difference between the development version of the website and the deployed version is that it does not have a login page and does not have filtered search results after the user has typed in into the search bar.
